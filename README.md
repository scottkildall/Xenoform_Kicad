#### Some Custom Kicad Symbols and Footprints
#### by Scott Kildall



### Overview
I have several custom symbols and footprints for parts and circuits, that I've created with Kicad 5.0

### Parts

(1) TRS Jack:

This is a common TRS jack (stereo audio). I'm not using the inner 2 pins, which are connected to ground, except for mounting. The middle pin is also GND, so this is redundant.
